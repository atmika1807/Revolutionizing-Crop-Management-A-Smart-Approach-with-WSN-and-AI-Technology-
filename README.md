# Revolutionizing-Crop-Management-A-Smart-Approach-with-WSN-and-AI-Technology-
🌾 Smart Crop Management Dashboard
A real-time crop recommendation and monitoring system using AI/ML, built with Streamlit and Firebase, to assist farmers and agricultural researchers in making data-driven decisions for optimized crop growth.

📌 Project Overview
This application provides intelligent suggestions for crop actions based on live environmental sensor data — such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and nutrient levels. The project integrates a machine learning model trained to analyze sensor inputs and recommend suitable actions. Additionally, it logs all historical data for trend visualization and continuous improvement.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit (Python-based web UI)

Backend/Model: Scikit-learn + Joblib (model: crop_model.pkl)

Database: Firebase Firestore (for user auth and data storage in extended setups)

Deployment: Streamlit Share / Localhost

Logging: CSV file (crop_history.csv) for tracking predictions

🔍 Features
📈 Live sensor data input via sliders and dropdowns

🤖 ML-based prediction of crop management actions

🗂️ Automatic logging of each prediction with a timestamp

📊 Trend visualization of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity

🔐 Firebase Authentication-ready codebase
